# First-Portfolio

## This project is the first steps into my "offical portfolio"

This portfolio will outline the skills and attributes I will have as a web developer. My main motivation was for good practise of building a website and to give myself a basic outline fore my future portfolio, i will be adding to this throughout the years. In this portfolio I have shown and executed some knowledge of HTML and CSS.
